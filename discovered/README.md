# Discovery Outputs

This directory contains outputs generated by the discovery engine when scanning Azure environments. Generated files include resource inventory, state snapshots, and dependency maps that feed into the deployment engine for validation and planning. All discovery outputs are timestamped and versioned to maintain a complete audit trail of infrastructure state.
