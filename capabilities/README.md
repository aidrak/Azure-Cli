# Capability-Based Module System

This directory contains capability modules organized by Azure service domains (compute, networking, storage, identity, AVD). Each capability folder groups related operations that share a common domain. The modular structure enables independent feature development, testing, and reuse across different deployment scenarios. Operations within each capability are self-contained and follow a consistent interface pattern.
