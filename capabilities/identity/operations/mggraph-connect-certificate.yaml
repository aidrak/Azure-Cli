# Microsoft Graph Certificate Authentication
# ==============================================================================
#
# Purpose: Connect to Microsoft Graph using service principal with certificate
# Usage: ./core/engine.sh run identity/mggraph-connect-certificate
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Service principal with certificate uploaded to Azure AD
#   - Certificate installed in local certificate store
#   - Credentials configured in secrets.yaml:
#     service_principal:
#       client_id: "..."
#       certificate_thumbprint: "..."
#
# Certificate Setup (Linux):
#   pwsh -Command "Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath ./cert.pfx -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My"
#
